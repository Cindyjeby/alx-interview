<h1>Rotate 2D Matrix</h1>
<p>For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python. Below are the key concepts and resources that you need to grasp in order to successfully complete this project</p>

<h2>Concepts Needed:</h2>

<h4>Matrix Representation in Python:</h4>
<li>Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.</li>
<li>Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix</li>

<h4>In-place Operations:</h4>
<li>Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.</li>
<li>The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.</li>

<h4>Matrix Transposition:</h4>
<li>Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).</li>
<li>Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.</li>

<h4>Reversing Rows in a Matrix:</h4>
<li>Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.</li>

<h4>Nested Loops:</h4>
<li>Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.</li>
<li>Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.</li>

<p>By understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be able to approach the problem methodically, first transposing the matrix and then reversing each row to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation. This project not only tests your ability to manipulate 2D matrices but also challenges you to think about optimizing your solution to operate in-place, thus improving their problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills in Python.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise</p>
<li>Prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):</li>
<li>Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.</li>
<li>You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.</li>
